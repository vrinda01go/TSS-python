## Numpy
### What is NumPy?
NumPy stands for Numerical Python. One of the most fundamental packages in Python, NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package.It is a Python library used for working with arrays.It provides high-performance multidimensional array objects and tools to work with the arrays. NumPy is an efficient container of generic multi-dimensional data.
NumPy’s main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array where their dimensions are called axes and the number of axes is called rank. NumPy’s array class is called ndarray aka array.To read more about NumPy head over to this [link](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/whatisnumpy.html)

### Installation of Numpy
  For installation you can refer [this](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/numpy_getting_started.asp)
  Once you are done with the installation part , you can use it by importing it in your applications by adding **import** keyword. 



## Pandas
Pandas is an open-source Python package that provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the labeled data in Python programming language. Pandas stand for **Python Data Analysis Library**.
**When to use?**
Pandas is a perfect tool for data wrangling or munging. It is designed for quick and easy data manipulation, reading, aggregation, and visualization.
Pandas take data in a CSV or TSV file or a SQL database and create a Python object with rows and columns called a data frame. The data frame is very similar to a table in statistical software, say Excel or SPSS.

### What can you do with Pandas?
* Indexing, manipulating, renaming, sorting, merging data frame
* Update, Add, Delete columns from a data frame
* Impute missing files, handle missing data or NANs
* Plot data with histogram or box plot

## Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a data visualization library and 2-D plotting library of Python.It is a close resemblance to MATLAB embedded in Python programming language.
Histogram, bar plots, scatter plots, area plot to pie plot, Matplotlib can depict a wide range of visualizations. With a bit of effort and tint of visualization capabilities, with Matplotlib, you can create just any visualizations.
Matplotlib also facilitates labels, grids, legends, and some more formatting entities with Matplotlib. Basically, everything that can be drawn!
