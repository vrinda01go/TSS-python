### What is NumPy?
NumPy stands for Numerical Python. One of the most fundamental packages in Python, NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package.It is a Python library used for working with arrays.It provides high-performance multidimensional array objects and tools to work with the arrays. NumPy is an efficient container of generic multi-dimensional data.
NumPy’s main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array where their dimensions are called axes and the number of axes is called rank. NumPy’s array class is called ndarray aka array.To read more about NumPy head over to this [link](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/whatisnumpy.html)
