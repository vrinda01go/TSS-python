# Welcome to Week 2 of Learner Space's Python and its Applications!

For this week we will look at Applications of Python in Data Analysis fields and will cover various python libraries used for this namely :
* [Numpy](#Numpy)
* [Pandas](#Pandas)
* [Matplotlib](#Matplotlib)
* [Seaborn](#Seaborn)
* [Scikit-learn](#Scikit-learn)
* [Assignment](#Assignment)

Let's get started!

## Numpy
### What is NumPy?
NumPy stands for Numerical Python. One of the most fundamental packages in Python, NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package.It is a Python library used for working with arrays.It provides high-performance multidimensional array objects and tools to work with the arrays. NumPy is an efficient container of generic multi-dimensional data.
NumPy’s main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array where their dimensions are called axes and the number of axes is called rank. NumPy’s array class is called ndarray aka array.To read more about NumPy head over to this [link](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/whatisnumpy.html)

### Installation of Numpy
For installation you can refer [this](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/numpy_getting_started.asp)
Once you are done with the installation part , you can use it by importing it in your applications by adding **import** keyword. 
  
### Getting Started With Numpy

Check this [notebook](https://github.com/vrinda01go/TSS-python/blob/main/Python%20Library/NumPy.ipynb) to get basic knowledge of Numpy.Relevant links to websites and documentations have been provided in the notebook itself.  




## Pandas
Pandas is an open-source Python package that provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the labeled data in Python programming language. Pandas stand for **Python Data Analysis Library**.
**When to use?**
Pandas is a perfect tool for data wrangling or munging. It is designed for quick and easy data manipulation, reading, aggregation, and visualization.
Pandas take data in a CSV or TSV file or a SQL database and create a Python object with rows and columns called a data frame. The data frame is very similar to a table in statistical software, say Excel or SPSS.

### What can you do with Pandas?
* Indexing, manipulating, renaming, sorting, merging data frame
* Update, Add, Delete columns from a data frame
* Impute missing files, handle missing data or NANs
* Plot data with histogram or box plot

### Getting Started With Pandas

Check this [notebook](https://github.com/vrinda01go/TSS-python/blob/main/Python%20Library/Pandas.ipynb) to get basic knowledge of Pandas .Relevant links to websites and documentations have been provided in the notebook itself.  




## Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a data visualization library and 2-D plotting library of Python.It is a close resemblance to MATLAB embedded in Python programming language.
Histogram, bar plots, scatter plots, area plot to pie plot, Matplotlib can depict a wide range of visualizations. With a bit of effort and tint of visualization capabilities, with Matplotlib, you can create just any visualizations.
Matplotlib also facilitates labels, grids, legends, and some more formatting entities with Matplotlib. Basically, everything that can be drawn!

### Installation of Matplotlib
For installation you can refer [this](https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_getting_started.asp)
Once you are done with the installation part , you can use it by importing it in your applications by adding **import** keyword.

## Seaborn
Check out [this](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/numpy_random_seaborn.asp) or [this](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/seaborn-python-tutorial).
You can also look at [Seaborn documenation](http://seaborn.pydata.org/introduction.html) to know more about Seaborn.




## Scikit-learn

Scikit-learn is a free software library for Machine Learning coding primarily in the Python programming language.Scikit-learn is built on top of other Python libraries like NumPy, SciPy,  Matplotlib, Pandas, etc. and so it provides full interoperability with these libraries.You can implement various Supervised and Unsupervised Machine learning models on Scikit-learn like Classification, Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Clustering, etc. with Scikit-learn. 

### Components of scikit-learn
Scikit-learn comes loaded with a lot of features. Here are a few of them to help you understand the spread:
* **Supervised learning algorithms**: Think of any supervised machine learning algorithm you might have heard about and there is a very high chance that it is part of scikit-learn. Starting from Generalized linear models (e.g Linear Regression), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees to Bayesian methods – all of them are part of scikit-learn toolbox.
* **Cross-validation**: There are various methods to check the accuracy of supervised models on unseen data using sklearn.
* **Unsupervised learning algorithms**: Again there is a large spread of machine learning algorithms in the offering – starting from clustering, factor analysis, principal    component analysis to unsupervised neural networks.
* **Feature extraction**: Scikit-learn for extracting features from images and text

Check out [this documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) to get a deeper understanding of deploying it in machine learning, pre-processing, cross-validation and visualization algorithms.
